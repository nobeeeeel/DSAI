This is a mini project for our SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) module. In this project, we utilised the top 10 stocks from NASDAQ which we utilised from the Yahoo Finance API.
Within this repository, you will see the 2 code files, one for our linear regression and one for our QLearning bot.
